This API demo is a full Web API using .NET 9 with CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), using Entity Framework (EF) with code‑first migrations and SQL Server.
1. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project by exploring the default WeatherForecast example: model properties (date, temperature, summary); use of controllers, routes, and how HTTP attributes (e.g., [HttpGet]) define endpoints.
2. Building a sample “Toy” model & controller: define model with properties (id, title, platform, developer, publisher), add controller with in‑memory (static list) storage initially; building CRUD action methods (e.g. GET all, GET by id, POST) and observing HTTP responses / status codes.
3. Implementing update (PUT) and delete (DELETE) endpoints: matching route attributes and parameters; dealing with no content / not found responses; testing endpoints with tools.
4. Transitioning from in‐memory data to persistent storage: setting up DbContext, configuring SQL Server (Express here), connection strings in appsettings.json, provider for Entity Framework Core SQL Server, installing EF Core NuGet packages & tools.
5. Applying migrations and seed data: using EF migrations (Add‑Migration etc.), database update; inspecting database with SQL Server Management Studio; injecting DbContext via dependency injection (DI); replacing static list with DB access; making controller actions asynchronous (async/await) plus calling SaveChangesAsync.
